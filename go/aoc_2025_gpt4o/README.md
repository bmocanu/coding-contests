# Info

This folder contains AI-generated solutions for Advent of Code 2025.
I am using Copilot in VSCode with the gpt-4o model.

## Note

For each day, I first solve the day by myself (both parts) (see *aoc_2025* folder) and ONLY THEN
I pass the problem to the AI, to see if it has any issues with solving it.

## Prompt

I have a problem for which I need the Go code to solve the problem. 
The problem might be complex, so make sure that you create the code to solve it efficiently, including approaches like dynamic programming and such.
For the program input, read the data as described by the problem from an external file called "input.txt", located in the "aoc_2025" folder.
